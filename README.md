# Pong-Game-using-Raspberry-Pi-SenseHat
Abstract
Our project focuses on implementing a classic Pong Game using the Sense HAT 
on the Raspberry Pi platform. The Sense HAT, equipped with an LED matrix and 
various sensors, serves as an interactive interface for the game. The project 
combines hardware and software components to create an engaging gaming 
experience. Players control a paddle using the Sense HAT joystick to bounce a 
ball back and forth, aiming to achieve the highest score possible. The project not 
only provides entertainment but also serves as an educational tool for learning 
about hardware interfacing and game development on the Raspberry Pi.
